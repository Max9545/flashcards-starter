This was a partly built app  called Flash Cards that I completed using Test Driven Development. I brought it to a point where a user can quiz their own programming knowledge via the command line in the Terminal.

## Installation

```javascript
git clone [https://github.com/turingschool-examples/flashcards-starter.git][my_flashcards]

cd my_flashcards


```

## Usage

```javascript
node index.js
```
Use the 1, 2, and 3 keys to choose the correct answer
Press enter key to see if your chosen answer is correct
Press Enter Key again to move to next question
